Think what to do.
I'll take some strength to banish hollow sorrow.
Hollow sorrow's nothing new.
Just enough strength to last until tomorrow
Until I believe in my soul.
Tonight I lost sight of all purpose
Despite all this trickery you told me was right.
I was such a good boy I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's my prize?
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Ah you must be fucking joking.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. Yes yes.
Would you repeat that. Break it to me gently,
Stand over there.
Oh I know I was an arrogant boy but I let you hold the door
Oh I was kind. I was nice, where's the prize?
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two.
Oh but you're going too fast for me here,
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop! Let me get this clear
(That's all there ever is) oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) yes, yes. ha ha ha.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. yes. yes.
You see I know what this is, I know
What's going on here, this is just the difference between ...
It's the battle between the body and the soul. The spirit
And what's needed here...
What I intend to do now is I'm going to punish my body.
I'll punish the body to believe in the soul, I will punish
My body, until I believe in my soul.","['80s', 'soul', 'british', 'Blue-Eyed Soul', 'new wave', 'post-punk', 'angst', 'Seederman Top Pick', 'cooper was here', 'Falseto bacano']",3

Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
Secrets below the service of truth I hid 'em
This man kind is past, but can he erase
The tears of a million years is human race
Of animals, that talk and walk upright
Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
Mysteries, maybe not
It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
I hold a pen with the grip so tight
That'a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
This microphone, like an an amphetamine
Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
So nature can intervene, just for a scene

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

I walk along this path alone, my feet hurt
Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt
I went to church, I tried everything
From leaving my body, to watching the birds sing
For hours, so I could feel heavenly powers
Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
But what is it worth, I'm still just a man on the earth
Rappers are acting like man tan
Can I be candid, I can't stand it
Rap bandit, got heaven acting frantic
I wanna swing my sword decapitate
But what is a man if he acts like an ape
So I sit back, planning my great escape
Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyond me
So what is reality, I don't know

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Wrong song
You know what
I woke up in the morning
I took a trip to the corner store
That's when I heard my calling
But I'd never heard the voice of truth before
So I kept on walking
Pretended I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be seen
Holla and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall

It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

It's till the day we die

'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cause we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.
And we could only see each other we'd bleed together,
These arms would not be taught to need another's

Am I the only one who realizes they stink?

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)

So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!

You know the light has left his face
But you can't recall just where or why

No rest at all in freedom
Of the choices we are given
It's no choice at all
The proof is in the fire
You touch before it moves away

Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault.
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
But I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Will you wait for me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I've lost a lot of what I don't expect to ever return
I tend to push them till the pushing's turned from hurt into burn
I always take them to that place they thought they wanted to go
Then end up dancing round, this clown commands applause at his show

Let me paint this picture for you baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone

I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

Tell my girl two wrongs still don't make a right
Make love for the last time under the candlelight

After that hit the club and reminisce about the High School Days

Turn up the bass and move to his stylings
Cant leave without reading my daughter a bedtime story

It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years
Since we last seen each other
Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
'Cause everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Ooh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her

Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid
Ooh, and now
(See now that I found the love of my life)
(I don't have to trick no more)

But I gotta go home to my baby boo

Funk from the fungus grown in the trench

Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Trade 'em for a pair Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes

Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty
Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny

With a swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction

As I greet the many people that I meet with a hello

And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back

I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure

Leads to one mistake

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go

Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go

I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight,
Because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,

And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be

We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same

I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance

And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right

In the story of your heart

I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

First it's to easy to say I need, I love you
I will try to describe what I mean, how it feels like
For that, I use worked melodies sincere

You were my heaven on earth, the light of myself
Through you I gave birth, you made me a woman
Every colour of my world, that's what you are
Like a lion rules the jungle you rule my heart

Thank you, you turn my nights into days
'Cause every second and a minute of each hour I need to see your face
I need you, touch you, smell you, hug you, all through the day
Kiss you, hug you, smell you, touch you, teas you, please you and say your name

No matter what we'll be, with you and me
You'll always have my soul, my heart, my love my everything x2","['reggae', 'female vocalists', 'soul', 'Ayo', 'easy listening', 'Neo-Soul', 'female', 'jazz', 'pop', 'happy', 'acoustic', 'Mellow', 'great', 'norah jones', 'rnb', 'relaxing', 'vocalists', 'joy', 'ulubione', 'good mood', 'Do Not Forget', 'spokojna', 'soft parade', 'Pierwsza', 'litanias do cio', 'Vertic', 'almazgz', 'sweet pie']",1
2012,TRADXMA128F4276D94.h5,Dead Prez,Be Healthy,"It's all love.

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily, to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap 'cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
And, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
Cause you don't want to lose - vitamins and minerals
And that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable, so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
'Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy.
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin' better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Y'all.

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...""","['indie', 'indie pop', 'Scottish', 'twee', 'pop', 'belle and sebastian', 'alternative', 'rock', 'chamber pop', 'british i like', 'amayzes loved', 'indie rock', 'twee pop', 'davaho53', 'vugube62', 'seen live', 'british', 'folk', 'male vocalists', 'octwoct', 'classic', 'epic', 'singersongwriter', 'bop', 'britpop', 'krautrock', 'upbeat', 'glasgow', 'Radio', 'literate', 'Mellow', 'gay', 'melancholy', 'amazing', 'Rainy Day', 'nice', 'shoegazer', 'Favourites', 'english', 'Love it', 'gdchills90s', 'favorite tracks', 'art', 'Dream', 'emusic', 'dance party', 'Dancable', 'dreams', '1996', 'james', 'dancy', 'election', 'songs that make me happy', 'good song', 'bedroom dancing', 'art pop', 'singable', 'songs I absolutely love', 'All time favourite', 'stardust', 'my soundtrack', 'Do caralho', 'scottish indie', 'Rich B', 'nice and cosy', 'session', 'scot', 'bs', 'wicked bass', 'come pick me up', 'songs about bikes', 'natalicious partaychoonz', 'AlternativeTwee', 'woozily', 'yay and hooray and yippee and huzzah', 'butIlikeit', 'kk', '0o', 'i love you stuart murdoch', 'delicia', 'music1', 'Only In Dreams', 'recent stuff including white stripes and portishead', 'groove-tastic', 'british love', 'what indie should be like', 'Tigermilk', 'funny dances', 'steveadamsfm', 'Temas Crema', 'shes a rainbow', 'the station that never sleeps', 'Top Played Tracks', 'strong memories', 'belle sebastian', 'Good in a way I cant even believe', 'sing uk', 'Wordpuppet', 'beautindie', 'amazing album covers lmfao very xxhardcorexx shit lol -laughs very hard for about the length of the song-']",1

Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
City sky reflects the silver street below,
And it covers up the cars,
And the Wall-flowers CD ended half an hour ago.

Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
And drive to find the show,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home.

Now he looks around his place and anyways,
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Or he'll have to take the bus instead.

Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back.","['acoustic', 'Mellow', 'chill', 'alternative', 'alternative rock', 'rock', 'indie rock', '90s', 'folk', 'sad', 'slow', 'calm', 'alternative pop rock', 'beautiful', 'guitar', 'soft', 'quiet', 'good', 'Ballad', 'post-grunge', 'alt rock', 'Curious', '8 of 10 stars', 'sweet', 'Love it', 'General Alternative', 'liebe', 'blue mind mix', 'Semisonic', 'songs that mention other artists', 'pop underground', 'chillig', 'traurig', 'uni', 'mustHear', 'rolig', 'acoustic soft', 'Dear Diary', 'hs', 'plucked or strummed', 'SundayMix', 'are you awake', 'xavinho', 'on radar']",4

Decisions made
Idea's mine
But the inspiration not
Dreams of hangers-on
Dreams of getting well
Spells of esmeralda
Amarose fortold

Splinters in the eye
Sentiments remain
Bones are never asked
Where are we going to
It was never up to me
And yet I pushed until it broke

I love the open road
And all that it suggests
Wheelwagon dust
Weeds and infidelities
And always swore our love
Never questioned why
In a wooden house
Immovable and silent
And drinking strawberry wine
Forever lost in town

And through the sleeping streets
Nightbound and heavy
Wheels in a spoke
Just a spoken foreign sound

Know my gates are high
My friends even higher
Forgotten in my mind
Yet the scars still lingering
Cloud the blue skies
I'm jealous of you birds
Was the only truth
In a world full of words

Hear the prairie sound
In a friend called Neil
The heart is pointed down
But my spirit pointed up
His voice the siren
Of greek mythology

I pause with my pen
I begin to defend
Every action taken
Every moment sealed
When I was quick
It coursed through open veins
The will to live
The urgency to move
Behind a panel door
Sealing cherry stain
I played my guitar
And lived those lonesome notes

Like a dog that's down
In a corner just aside
Waiting to be called
Waiting to be yours
Ghosts of a machine
Without purpose or will

I'll often speak of you
But the you was always me
'Cause when I speak of me
It's me I ask of you
So let there be no truth
Just trickery in rhymes
Time the only thing
Waiting still is death

I hope for resolution
Pray one defining moment
Pause without restraint
Barren without child
A child is who I was
A child is who I'll die
A child is who I'll die

Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

To sell shit to an art school lame

Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail

When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows

Unrelated to your three-legged
Preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
Like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)

To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out

Points a finger at me (finger at me)

And when you wake up in the morning give yer momma a kiss

Held me like I was made of gold

And whatever he's doing he's doing the right thing
It's frightening, but it makes me mad
Why do all of these people seem to hate my dad?
And if that ain't enough now I get these spots
I go to sleep every night with my stomach in knots
And what's more, I can hear momma next door
Explore the radio for reports of war

As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight-
Train moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up; the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late

I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

No matter how long it takes

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'

To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'

Could've drowned in it
Woulda floated bloated, voted sugar coated
Loaded hip shooter

Draw for the poor
Free coffee at the banks

None more for me, thanks

That blanks the raw
That dank sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit
For more hardcore prank spit

Crank it on blast

Juiced off of junk treat

No repetirá jamás.

Mil años no me alcanzarán
Para borrarte y olvidar.

Y ahora estoy aquí
Queriendo convertir
Los campos en ciudad
Mezclando cielo con el mar
Sé que te dejé escapar
Sé que te perdí
Nada podrá ser igual.

Mil años pueden alcanzar
Para que puedas perdonar

Nunca las envié
No querrás saber de mí

Son suficientes para amar.

Translation:
I know you won't come back, 
everything that was; 
Time has left it behind. 
I know that you won't return. 
What happened between us 
will never be repeated. 
A thousand years will never reach me 
to fade you away and forget. 
And now I'm here, 
Trying to turn valleys into cities 
Mixing the Sky and the Sea. 
I know I let you escape, 
I know I lost you. 
Nothing can be the same; 
A millenium can reach 
so you can fade away. 
Chorus: 
I'm here, loving you, 
suffocating, 
in photographs and scrapbooks, 
in objects and momentos. 
I can't comprehend, 


I'm driving myself mad. 
Changing a foot for 
my own face; 
This night for a day. 
And there's nothing I can do about it. 

The letters I wrote, 
I never sent. 
You didn't want to know of me. 
I can't understand 
how foolish I was; 
It's all the matter of time and faith. 
A millenium with another thousand years... 
are enough to love

You know I'm still waiting for you...

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

Leaves you with a fever

When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great
And hanging on for more

Just call me vagabond
Wondering in the sun
This is getting sort of old
Wandering aimlessly
Is it empty streets, or empty me?

Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great

And hanging on for more

Holding on for more, hoping, praying,
This will all start over
Come back for me
We will walk the streets
Of this old town
Make me a promise
This will all come back around

Leaves you with a fever

2809,TRAIPST128F9302AE9.h5,Eminem,Beautiful,"Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)

Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.

On a peculiar choreography
With the dead arms of some old southern tree

And it makes you wanna reborn
And like a snake crawl every warm season
Into a different form

When you can still cure me

Through the blank of my closed eyes
You can foresee the rope within

And it makes you wanna know
How deep have you truly flown

And it makes you wanna ride
Through the fake suicide of someone
Already dead inside

Still you walk with me, silently

And it makes you wanna disclaim
Something you had really never learnt

And it makes you wanna stay
Forever tangled in the pale arms of some hanged man

In a world where the world ends at the end of your block
And them, uh, little whirlwinds spin friction 'round the clock
I be savage, hunt and gather the average rather cadaver
Cock back hammer, splatter matter all over cell phone and calendar

No peace, yeah, in the middle of a war zone

No sleep, yeah, with the shades down low
On the down low fighting with a dream

I don't need to speak
I'm paranoid like a man in the land of the free
To set up and let us burn turn cheek

I'm gone off my rock, no songs, no more locked
Just a little bit of prison sneakin' up on us
We won't listen till there isn't any more of us
These days we quick to part ways with rights, like, okay here
But let's be clear, for the record, I did not sign up for lockdown

Nothing less than aggression
So naked, so crystal clear, with a trust

It's like they leave us no option
Walkin' these streets here just watching
These preachers speak from their pockets
These teachers, bring it back
These teachers reach but can't stop it
Seedlings so poisoned, so lost
Just following prophets to nonsense
Tossin' what's right to the dust

And I ain't no casualty
Got no surface with spotless morality
My dirt might have to cover up my grave
But I keep my fear of faith and filth clutter up my cave
Got me lookin' for my disinfectant

Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ah...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ah...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn...","['black metal', 'Symphonic Black Metal', 'Norwegian Black Metal', 'metal', 'melodic black metal', 'norwegian', 'True Norwegian Black Metal', 'Emperor', 'symphonic metal', 'Extreme Metal', 'atmospheric black metal', 'true black metal', 'i had to change my pants after this song', 'Norway', 'progressive black metal', 'heavy metal', 'seen live', 'epic', 'atmospheric', 'symphonic', 'melodic metal', 'Technical Death Metal', 'Masterpiece', 'Favourite Songs', 'norwegian metal', 'Atmospheric metal', 'awesome songs', 'chillout', 'classic', 'punk', 'favorites', 'dark', 'beautiful', 'Awesome', 'viking metal', 'Melodic Death Metal', '90s', 'poetry', 'Psychedelia', 'satanic', 'brilliant', 'black death metal', 'Depeche Mode', 'anti-christian', 'Black', 'deathcore', 'Seminal', 'Brutal Death Metal', 'nsbm', 'vampires', 'technical', 'Dark metal', 'Amazing song', 'Avant-Garde Black Metal', 'Extreme Black metal', 'epic songs', 'fave songs', 'Viking', 'old school black metal', 'Symphonic Extreme Metal', 'garten metal', 'Death Black Metal', 'symphonic black', 'DM', 'I would rather beat myself to death with a hammer than listen to this', 'ausgezeichnet', 'music that gets me my dick hard', 'ROOLZ', 'Symphonic Melodic Black Metal', 'second wave black metal', 'sophisticated black metal art', 'Eksprimentell-teknisk-avantgarde-saer-dop-steikbra-metal-musikk', 'dobra rzeznia', 'agregar', 'false lyrics', 'emporor', '90s black metal', '90s norwegian black metal', 'myk black metal', 'Melodic Norse Black Metal', 'songs to play after you sit for an hour waiting for a bus', 'choice of Nyest', '107miri', 'Emperor With Strength i burn', 'HAIL Emperor', 'THANK YOU EMPEROR']",2

Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love

Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late

And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year

And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for

Talks business with my father

That you're standing on your own

Into a world divided
You're thrown

Although you try try and try
To tell yourself

Said how you gonna make it on your own

Maybe luck is a lady

That you just kissed away

I guess that cupid was in disguise

The way that love can you set you free

I think you're amazing

You tried to save me from myself
Said darling, kiss as many as you want
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable

Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom, was always acting crazy

Blessed she in aching silence- eternal loss
Calling out ""I won't surrender""
A locket of her hair
Sympathize her pious pleasures
Go down the stairs into the dark again
To feel alive again, and wait for
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time?
Because it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Real love
Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow
Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it lies.
Or is what we're seeking
Real love
In the eyes
Behold and you'll find the 21st century
Detonate her will and her widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow
The rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tomorrow
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
'Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love
We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of my fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting by, totally. Drifting
By (just) totally. Drifting by (just) totally

Q-Tip:
The deadly venom, let me start from the beginning
We always hittin, so yo, there'll be no extra innings
As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction (what!)
The main feature
And I'm a greet ya, like a rhymin ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start
And that's me Aqui, as long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand
'Cause that happens to be the nature of man
Sexuality, it is the format baby
Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes
But I praise Lord in the worlds that's unseen
Respect me for that and let me do my thing (just)
I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing

(Drifting by) You know we gotta get a hold
(Suddenly) Over the illest drum rolls
(Suddenly drifting by just...)

Yo, how you doin'? Let me give you an intro
My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back, and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MCs resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncin my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your ego on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your click
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see my name's not dick
The Tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
But that's i-ight. Now, I'm on some true work shit
And I'ma make it happen for my whole outfit

(Drifting by) You know we got to get control
(Suddenly) Over the illest drum rolls
(Suddenly drifting by just...) Third verse

A-yo, we just gettin' started
Got to redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower
Plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison
Y'all really need to go lay down
'Cause positivity has risen
We hittin
Yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time
We ain't jokin
For security we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doin' the hustle
And you backstage voguin
We all got flaws
Don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings
There's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme
Damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel
But next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight
That we don't need
We slim with disabilities and
Thick with possibilities
'Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigatin with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
Let's strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still rebels
There ain't no plan B's
Yo watch, we movin through with plan A
Money market doin' things the right way

I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

And I don't know how to fix it

Beneath a snowy veil?

Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door

I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

Let's go!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

Crack through your heart and take the evil apart

Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me
For you have been a refuge

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall
May the king answer you on the day that you call
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled,

The holy one enthroned upon the praises of Israel

With dog eyes and a hanging tongue

They let me keep the soil moist

Too much time spent on nothing

And arms too long

Maybe for you, now

Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream
And on the phone I could not compete
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak
And for a sec', I thought I sounded sweet
But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice
I heard myself speak

And I can tell a joke
But one of these days, I'm bound to choke

And we could share a kiss
But I feel like I can't go through with this
And I bet we could build a home
But I know the right thing for me to do
Is to leave you alone
Leave you alone, now

That's when she turned to me and said
""I'm not sure anymore...""

And now, amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That'd blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something 
That you thought would never end
And then of course it did?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin
And then something had to give?

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

And now something 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me 
If i'm already gone

Well now something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now let's say that something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now that we
Make the same mistakes, we're always hanging on
Break those promises we're always leaning on
All this time spent waking up
I keep this line open to get this call from you 
Speak the words
That keep me coming back to you
Now this time it's all different

When I rock the mic you got to like the way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin' and explodin'

On the scene mean I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that is of which I chose
To make a rhyme and chill then you know

I will fulfill to make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy if he's a sucker

Hang 'em to the left of me 'cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and the microphone that I own
And my game plan is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush it ain't no race

I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya

Runnin' around holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy yo man
You hear what he said another funky rhythm
Look at ya man and give him a high five

'Cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work, I go to work
I go to work like an architect

I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word

With each letter it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone daddy's home

Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace

Start the race I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya I have to slap ya

Senseless with endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time

I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

I go to work I go to work I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya

So hard it stops ya dead in your tracks
So power packed before you can react
You're flat on your back down for the count
Get up and dismount 'cause I'm coming
With an endless amount of words in a hurry like a flurry

A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote rhymes at a level so you can't relate unless you're intelligent

So stay awake sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil

Rhymes in its highest form I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up a few casualties but so what
If you're slow you blow you know you go I flow
I throw all pro I go to work I go to work To say rap is not work

Is ludicrous whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me you'll compare me to a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation, I get paid to rock the nation

The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Lyrical valow, in club, in the go
In jeep in America, tribe go mad
Females ride when my niggas just ride
With the songs we creating and musically relating
Sex niggas talk, my body's in chart
Meanwhile they boot shaking
On some funk shit faking
Wait, I can't front, stick men
Here's a few who really come to do
What they say gonna do
Back at the ranch
There's no car branch
Everybody gonna move when we say move

Who could be the one
Rhyming ill, having fun
Blowing up, making musical memories and things
Elevate your thoughts on the vibe that we brought
While we climbing we shine like a super bowl ring
You could do it too
I mean hot like we do
It's a lot like we do and make your own mark
It's deeper than the song
Hope you live your life long
When you win, how you start, kid you gotta have heart
Niggas in my shit, move
Give a nigga room
Back it up, it's a grown man making on time
Plus you damn similar to newport's
Smoking ain't a new sport
Smoke you sister in vendible
Gotta spread love, no matter where you are
Where you at, where you went
'Cause nobody want beef
Fountain is good, just flows like a river
Just go with a nigga, kid my stay ain't brief
Put your heart in the day, in the night, family

And the lakes turn to ice

You pick up Little Dynamite I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
And Rosie you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us

Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right

And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand

I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't...
(...Have any money)
Oh, your papa says he knows...
(...That I don't have any money)
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have...
(...Any money)
Well, tell him this is last chance
To get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'

Te regalo mi locura
Y las pocas neuronas que quedan ya.

Te doy hasta mis suspiros,
Pero no te vayas más,
Porque eres tú mi sol,
La fe con que vivo,
La potencia de mi voz,
Los pies con que camino,
Eres tú, amor,
Mis ganas de reírme,
El adiós que no sabré decir 
Porque nunca podré vivir sin ti.
Si algún día decidieras,
Alejarte nuevamente de aquí,
Cerraría cada puerta,
Para que nunca pudieras salir.

Te regalo mi nariz,

I give you my madness

the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to live
the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live without you

If one of these day you would decide to get away from me
I would close every door, so you could never go out
I give you my silence, I give you my nose,
I give you even my bones, but stay here.

Too many choices
In New York I found a friend
To drown out the other voices

Voices on the cell phone
Voices from home
Voices of the hard sell
Voices down the stairwell
In New York, just got a place in New York

In New York summers get hot
Well into the hundreds
You can't walk around the block
Without a change of clothing

Hot as a hairdryer in your face
Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
New York, I just got a place in New York
New York, New York

In New York you can forget
Forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in
But it's down to Alphaville

New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York

The Irish have been coming here for years
Feel like they own the place
They got the airport, city hall, concrete, asphalt
They even got the police

Irish, Italian, Jews and Hispanics
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew
Living happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In New York I lost it all
To you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out
My midlife crisis

I hit an iceberg in my life
But you know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice whispering
""Come away, child""

Cause in the hills is my cure.

No spewing faces to bug me.

Some cleansing water to wash away the grime of city laughter
Off my face.

You tilted my hand

And rain fell through the night

With revenge and doubt

I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin' down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin' a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nothin' but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin'
I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised in Compton)

(Where you from, fool?)
(Compton)

Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin' out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin' like this, and I'm comin' directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
'Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

(Born and raised in Compton)

Yo, check this shit out
Right about now
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up nigga?
What's up KK?
My buddy D
We got AMG most definitely in the house
What's up Pretty Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin'
Talkin' about the Armstrong Pack
Straight got my muthafuckin back

You know what's happenin', fool

Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise
Of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around

And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
With drawbridges closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands

I threw my money and I ran away

Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls died
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring

You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away

Hard to stop wondering why

You can't see her but you do

It's the seven layers of pleasure
My genuine draft with the Loer acurate measures
Precision on beats if your camp is wanted where ever
I'm bring in the vein, clappin rhythmes to stormy weather

(Sonny Cheeba)
Bro', kissin' in quiet fire
Higher will get us lower
Staufer, she coffe diggin
Riggin' in shattered lifers
We only jive talkin'
Razor keep cotton squawkin
Blazin' the loose cannans
On top of white diomonds sands
Street corner symphonies spillin
Prisons are lower twistin
Brown Hornet keepin' it nappy
Keep us on, keepin' on

(Geechie Suede)
??...Shades to black
Gleamin of the roof of the Ac
Don't know how to act
Wildin' with the non-chalant pack
Slappin the thieves
With the unbelieves
That it be
Shakin your block
With the six million dollar bop
Just stop
The bloodclot tears
For years, we air-tight (tight)
On another flight
Until the farenheit (Harlem night)
Harlem night
I'm shakin your thoughts keepin' the Lo blaze sharp for life
It's a jungle masquerade and we forever stone trife

(Sonny Cheeba)
That chick out the car commin from the island of ice
No contact with sheist bubblin with mr. midnight
And talkin' in jive floatations
With cases
Of slick and shovelin herb hip tone
From black belt jones
The ebony junction'll
Be the function
Yo, dig it
Time to shake a leg, get up in your wig suga (sparkly)

Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you till I join you

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Uh and now I know I got some family
Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to come bruise me

And even though maybe were in there
Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee naughty invented family of the 90's

See what started as a family forest

Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Life doesn't end when the sweat dries
A time when a nickel cost a dollar
When you rise your chest dies
My dynasty many fear it 'cause I'm near it

Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan

To get my people help my people get a load of land
And I'm'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land

Since they broke every promise I devised a plan this
Black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky
Those who turn. they back with they fears

And try to before they can see us
They gonna need us sweet Jesus

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

Die nigga, die nigga

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Burning in hell, but don't deserved to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
It's because they heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be poppin', robbin and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From Ohio to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', a 129
Up the school street 'cause I come through mine
Barking my dogs, get at me nigga
Arf arf arf
Get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
Then come for the star
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go
Feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' getcha
With the steal, what you don't know is gon' splitcha
I can blaze tracks
Make niggas play raps and raise stacks
Paybacks a bitch, didn't you used to say that
Play around in dirt, you get mugged
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns to mudred and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time soldier eighth done told us not to hate
But then it's out of state, and it's too late
For change is to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, that nigga's got to give me a place
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me away
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always his versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Before you talk about your life
Protect yourself just keep quiet

To spoil your ways to spread lies

Hit the wall,
Scream out loud,
As you start to crawl
Back in your cage
The only place
Where they will
Leave you alone.
'Cause the weak will
Seek the weaker till they've broken them.
Could you get it back again?
Would it be the same?
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
Left you with no defense;
They tore it down.

And I have felt the same as you,
I've felt the same as you,
I've felt the same.

Locked inside
The only place
Where you feel sheltered,
Where you feel safe.
You lost yourself
In your search to find
Something else to hide behind.

The fearful always preyed upon your confidence.
Did they see the consequence,
When they pushed you around?
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
Breaking them till they've become just another crown.

Refuse to feel anything at all,
Refuse to slip,
Refuse to fall.
Can't be weak,
Can't stand still,
You watch your back 'cause no one will.
You don't know why they had to go this far,
Traded your worth for these scars,
For your only company.
And don't believe the lies
That they have told to you. Not one word was true
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right.","['rock', 'alternative', 'Lifehouse', 'alternative rock', 'christian', 'simon', 'chill', 'indie', 'sad', 'Mellow', 'nice', 'great lyrics', 'pop', 'pop rock', 'favorites', 'epic', 'beautiful', 'american', 'emotional', '00s', 'Ballad', 'Favourites', 'alt rock', 'christian alternative', 'break my heart', 'so sad and lonely', 'seen live', 'albums I own', 'USA', 'calm', 'Love', 'soft rock', 'romantic', 'Awesome', 'moody', 'peace', 'haunting', 'normal', 'amazing', 'spiritual', 'christian rock', 'favourite', 'quiet', 'good', 'male vocalist', 'male vocalists', 'buy', 'depression', 'Favorite', 'best', 'chill out', 'import', '8 of 10 stars', 'sweet', 'pain', 'life', '2000s', 'light', '6 of 10 stars', '2000', 'depressive', 'aternative', 'Awesome song', 'Greatest', 'adult alternative rock', 'best ever', 'rocking out', 'relationships', 'derb', 'slower', 'amigos', 'baaa-you-tiful', 'oh so sad', 'calma', 'Rustig', 'amei', 'bpluscoop', 'higor', 'my loved', 'WM List', 'Greatest Artists', 'still good', 'hold me tonight', 'tportal', 'quote this', 'jr high man', '90coop', 'nina myers', 'thablackphoenix', 'fideist', 'july 10', 'mainstream radio', 'simijimi', 'stoon', 'ost frankgardy', 'Muse Radio', 'lando alt 1', 'song titles with male names', 'zuvin', 'Sday']",2

Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry (everyday...)
Yes everyday I fall (everyday...)
Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
Why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry
Ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)
And everyday I fall (everyday...)
It makes me wonder why (everyday...)
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'Cause every way there is to cry,

You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still

He's a man with a mission, got a serious mind

The missionary man, he was following me
He said, ""Stop what you're doing, get down upon your knees.
I've a message for you that you better believe.""

The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day,
If today was your last day.

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try,
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day...
Would you make your mark
By mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars,
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
'cause the hands of time
Are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?

Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of

Shouting when it's quiet,
But no one's ever listening.

Through the mud and the rain,

From your previous life.

Chasing shadows moonlight mystery

And swing life away

I think it's time to move
The winters so cold
The summers over to soon
Let's pack our bags
And settle down where palm trees grow

I've got some friends
Some that I hardly know
We've had some times
I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down
With talks of places that we will go

We live on front porches
And swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor
I'll slave till the end
I won't cross these streets
Until you hold my hand
Until you hold my hand

I'll show you mine
If you show me yours first
Let's compare scars
I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages
And replace them with our own words

And swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor

But on another I can't relate...

Why I seldom try to break out of their scene.

So the frogs will hang and they'll always be hangin'...
Now we're here, what do we do?

I've been sortin' through the pros,
And cons of your eyes, farewell toads.
Can't you help move it along?

And I sure feel rotten long...

Well, it'll be a while.
I gotta unfry 'fore I pick it up with you.(Help me)
Do I need that stable care?
Don't I know that they'll be there?
Does that count now you've appeared?
Do I need that stable core?
Or do I jump for something more?

Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)

Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five, six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lila, she went to junior high with me
I said: ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last"", she said

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money)

(And his daddy's gone, somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life, mmm)

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
But that's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said: ""Everyday I wake up hoping to die""

She said: ""Nigga, I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to""

(What would you do?)
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
(What would you do?)
'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through

Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now

Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

We stay together out of fear of dying alone
I've been slipping through the years 
My old clothes don't fit like they once did
So they hang like ghosts of the people I've been

It's like my heart can't be tamed
And I fall in love every day and I feel like a fool
I have to face the truth 
That no one could ever look at me like you do
Like I'm something worth holding on to

And there's times I think of leaving
But it's something I'll never do
'Cause you can do better than me
But I can't do better than you

And too high to see below 
Just hangin' on your daily dose 

I know you never needed anyone 
But the rolling papers for your grass 
How can you give what you don't have 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore

Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life

When your time's on the door
And it drips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own

Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd

When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep show arcade
Where the future's not made

A nightmare situation
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past Holy wars
By the wall with broken laws

The leaders of men
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men
Just a strange infatuation

Self induced manipulation

And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane

So flawless
Or so they say, hey
Say, hey

And poses for pictures that aren't being taken

No makeup
So perfect

We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit, is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino
And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

(Prodigy)
Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss
Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs
Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin' in herds

When I woke up
You planted me in my own body
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong

When you said I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
And I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one

Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing

The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

My life's deep, listen,
Gotta bail, I'm limpin
Walked outta hell's kitchen
Why bother cherishin'
My past is everything, wrong, and my arrogance
Walk down the stairs pissin'
Cop us 'cause they're bitchin'
Life isn't fair, singin'
Blues and my rap drippin'
Ooze out the blood sinkin
Deep down to earth thinking
Leave out a nerp chicken
I should run, forfeit, and everything I know listen!

I was the misdirected
I was the least expected
Hop on and get rejected
Walk on and feel neglected
I feel like I'm the message
Unheard but I'm the message
I'm the last prolific remaining offer from the gutter

Shot was my girlfriend
When we was younger
Her I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death it's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

Smile when your struggling
Smile when you're in jail
Smile when your dead broke
Smile and the rents due
Smile you ain't got friends now
Smile and no one knows you
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding
Smile when he leaves you
Smile cause girl he needs you
Smile plenty single mothers cry the tears you do
Smile despite the war
Smile despite the pain yo
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding

To my man Kareem in prison
I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened
It can't be the same
I had to grow my intuition
Had me deep in pain
'Cause I knew my options were either broke or the prison chains
I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Dammit, I can't blow it
I got a judge telling me my life's key
They will throw it
No sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where

Therefore
I'm resurrected
They call me
The poor injection
I infect you with the real
The dustyfeetphilosahectagos
I spit, so sick
I skid out
I'm fallin'
I'm shit outta luck and I'm trapped but I'll get out

Can you help me
I'm going crazy
My mom plays trix and I beat on the floor like bush wick
My fists bloody and blistered
A pair like I'm ballistic
I just stare at the red and smile while I'm bleeding

There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I would walk with the kids that would bra sound ah
Never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper it was often foreseen
Yo say something bout my momma id shoot ya dead out clean
But ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up Mogadishu (tell em)
The only law was gun law
And we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when those big boys are firin'
War is no place for a child
Especially if hes rollin' with an ak and a smile
He had witnesses on mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, please, please
But never let 'em see you down smile while you bleedin'","['Hip-Hop', 'hip hop', 'rap', 'underground hip-hop', 'political', 'smile', 'somalia', 'autobiographical', 'never gonna hear it on the radio', 'amazing chorus', 'never let them see you bleed', 'indie', 'reggae', 'canada', 'favorites', 'happy', 'acoustic', 'Canadian', 'Awesome', 'african', 'spoken word', 'party', '2007', 'intense', 'Uplifting', 'male vocalists', 'soulful', 'live', 'underground hip hop', '2005', 'conscious hip-hop', '2000s', 'positive', 'conscious', 'somalian', 'good hiphop', 'African music', 'moron', 'Great hook', 'blka10k', 'the strombo show', 'somali', 'As above so below', 'Knaan', 'hip hop tag', 'inner strength', 'i know you have a little life in you yet', 'death by killer hook', 'triumph of the quixotic', 'to walk out on a limb and find that it holds', 'i was scarred yo i survived tho', 'the dusty foot on the road', 'the dusty foot philosopher', 'lyrically efficient', 'Pain Wave', 'northernblondies hood']",1

Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you

If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...

Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot

And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand

Some timers, Playa' hata's and dick riders
Bent niggaz' that be crashin into dividers
Gettin' you into shit got that ass tied up

With no plans of giving back live in serious debt.

With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what ""all right"" even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before

And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read

Then John, he got up from the table, slowly he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife and little children back home
How his drinking had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off into that streetlight
And the vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
For it was him, lying drunk in that gutter
Clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said

And walked away with someone else instead
You should have listened to what grandma said
And married someone more like Fred

You should have listened to your inner voice
While you had time and still a choice
You should have reached for the emergency brake
Before it was too late

You see the clever girl looks for a clever boy
To another extent than the clever boy
Will ever look for a mate
Who goes to round-table debates
And runs a little bit late
When she does work for the state

You see the clever girls look for a clever boys
And then the clever boys seem to have a different choice
They want a good-looking chick
That likes to blow them away
Someone who laughs at all the
Funny little things they say

I have a friend who's in this MENSA club
He has no trouble to admit
He wants a woman with ambitions
That go as far as raising kids

You see the clever girl looks for a clever boy
To another extent than the clever boy
Will ever look for a mate
Who goes to round-table debates
And runs a little bit late
When she does work for the state
You see the clever girl looks for a clever boy
To another extent than the clever boy

To another extent than the clever boy

You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it,
The more you want it
And then one day you get it,
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh...
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, know, know,
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Pale as disease... mocking... maddening...

Let you know how I feel
So if I stumble and if I fall, just help me back,
So I can make you see

Give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
Oh one more night,

Just staring at the phone
And always wondering, should I call you,
Then I thought, but maybe you're not alone

I will always be with you
And if you sailed away
I would follow you

Just give me that one more night
One more night,

I know there'll never be a time
You'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind,
You know that I'll be here
